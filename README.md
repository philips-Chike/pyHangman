# pyHangman
Hangman Game Project 

Usage: extract all files and run : python main.py 

The hangmanX files are graphics... I think there could be a function that changes it without having all these files..
art.py processes those files for now.

getchar.py is a function to get user input without pressing enter.. modified from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/134892/ 
logic.py is the game engine,
main.py is glue to put this all together, this is what must be run.
pickword.py is the function to grab the word from our wordlist sowpods.txt
